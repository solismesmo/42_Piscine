# Piscine
The "Piscine" is a distinctive stage of the selection process at 42 São Paulo, following the model of the 42 school, a global network of coding schools. The name "Piscine" is a reference to the intensity and rigor of this process, where candidates are subjected to a series of challenges and tests that last for several consecutive days. 

The main phase of the selection process is the "Piscine." This stage is an intensive programming bootcamp that lasts for several weeks. During the Piscine, candidates are subjected to a series of practical challenges that test their programming skills, problem-solving abilities, and teamwork. The idea is to identify candidates with potential, regardless of their academic background or prior programming experience.

# Self-learning 
During the process, candidates do not receive traditional lectures or formal instruction. Instead, they have access to online resources and work on practical projects. The goal is for them to learn programming through self-learning and collaboration with other candidates.

# Continuous Assessment
Throughout the Piscine, candidates are continuously evaluated. They need to reach specific milestones and complete projects to advance to the next stages of the selection process. Candidates who demonstrate good performance during the Piscine may be approved and invited to join the free education program at 42 São Paulo.

# Results
The results of the Piscina are communicated to the candidates, and those who progress to the next stage continue their learning journey at the school.
It's important to note that 42 São Paulo follows an innovative teaching model based on practical learning and collaboration among students. Additionally, the Piscina selection process is known for being challenging and rigorous, with the aim of identifying candidates with the potential and determination to become proficient programmers.
